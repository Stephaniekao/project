### Airbnb Business Intelligence Dashboard ###
# Pricing Insights & Market Competition Analysis #
# Dynamic, Dataset-Agnostic BI System for Market & Pricing Analysis #

This project builds an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard for analyzing Airbnb market competition.

It is fully dynamic and supports any Airbnb-style dataset (from Paris, New York, Tokyo, or any city), thanks to automated data-type detection and adaptive visualizations.

#　📦 Dataset Source

You can upload any CSV or Excel file containing Airbnb-like listing data.
The system automatically detects:
- Numerical columns
- Categorical columns
- Datetime columns
- Missing values
- Outliers
- Correlations

Example dataset:
Kaggle – Airbnb Paris Listings
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abaghyangor/airbnb-paris

(But the dashboard is not limited to Paris.)

# 👥 Intended Users

This dashboard is designed for:

- Travel Agencies  
- Resort / Hotel Managers  
- Airbnb Hosts  
- OTA Platforms (Booking / Agoda)  
- Tourism Boards  
- Data Analysts / BI Analysts  

# 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a market competition analysis tool for tourism and accommodation industries.
- Deliver a **dynamic**, **dataset-agnostic** BI dashboard with automated analysis.
- Allow users to:
  - explore pricing
  - compare room types
  - analyze guest capacity
  - inspect availability trends
  - evaluate host behaviors
  - compare neighborhood performance
- Enable users to upload various Airbnb datasets without modifying the source code.

# 💼 Business Value

Organizations can answer:

- Which areas are most competitive or profitable?
- How do different room types compare in pricing and occupancy?
- Do professional hosts perform better?
- What seasonal changes can be observed?
- How do price and review trends evolve over time?

The dashboard provides:

- Market price benchmarks  
- Neighborhood competitiveness  
- Host performance insights  
- Seasonal and trend analysis  
- Data-driven recommendations
